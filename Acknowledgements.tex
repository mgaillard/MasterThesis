\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank the initiators of the double Master IFIK for their valuable efforts and commitment to the German-French collaboration : Prof. Dr. Harald Kosch
for the German side and Prof. Dr. Lionel Brunie for the French side.

I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisors Prof. Dr. Michael Granitzer and Dr. El{\"o}d Egyed-Zsigmond, for their enthusiastic encouragement and useful critiques of this research work. 

I would also like to thank my friends from the double degree for their support and encouragement throughout my study. Especially Guillaume Kheng, Quidditch Deutscher Meister, who was also living with me in Braugasse and with whom I spend literally 99\% of my time in Passau. Thanks to him I did a lot of sport, I am sure that my work benefited from that.

Finally, a special thank to Morwenna Joubin, without whom it wouldn't be possible for me to submit this document from France, in time.
